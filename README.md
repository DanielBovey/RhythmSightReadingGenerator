# RhythmSightReadingGenerator
A two bar rhythm generator for sight-reading, written with javafx.

My first personal coding project, drawing together some of the skills I have worked on so far including event handling, lambda functions, enums, building GUI's with javafx and MIDI sequencing.

I've included a menu button which shows buttons to select which rhythmic values will be included or not in the generated rhythms and to change time signature. There is also a playback button which will play the displayed rhythm outloud against a click track.

I wanted an app to use in my guitar teaching to instantly generate random rhythms for my students to sight- read, which I can tailor via the menu to suit the studnents current level of ability.

Many updates are coming to include more functionality and improve the appearance of the app!
